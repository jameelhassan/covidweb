    We conduct research in the following thrusts.
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Data science for combatting COVID Pandemic: </b><br>
            We are developing algorithms to predict the COVID-19 case counts, outbreaks and severity on different scenarios. We also attemp to quantify the differential impact of COVID-19 on different communities and individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Computer vision for combatting COVID Pandemic:</b><br>
            We are developing computer vision pipelines to asses the risk and suggest preventive measures for COVID-19 transmission in different scenarios.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Data science for combatting Dengue Pandemic:</b><br>
            We are developing predictive algorithms to tackle the Dengue outbreaks.
